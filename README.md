## What is ThxJSer

ThxJSer is a Single Page Application **(SPA)** frameworks

\- a toolkit - for people who build web sites using javaScript and React.

## What is SPA

Different from traditional *server side rendering(SSR)*, SPA is separation of front-end and backend, making division clear.

Using SPA, you can deploy the frontend(views) without worrying about backend's language.

SPA load data from backend dynamically by using Ajax request(API call), this capability makes it no need to wait entire page's extra reloading.

Hence, SPA has faster performance and easily content render with JSON data from APIs.
